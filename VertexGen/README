To generate e+- pairs using generate:
1. $ rm CMakeCache.txt cmake_install.cmake
   $ rm -r CMakeFiles
2. $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
   and Makefile is generated
3. $ make
   then generate is generated
4. ./generate
5. Output data are stored in events.run???.dat
   , events.runno stores current run number 
6. The output format is:
   KE_p KE_q Theta_p Phi_p Theta_q Phi_q CrossSection
   Where all Theta Phi are in spherical angle in degrees,
   relative to beam direction, also horizontal plane Phi = 0/180 degrees
